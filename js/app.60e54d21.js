originally created a chrome extension to allow myself to apply to jobs faster by         mapping details such as job position, company name, and job requirements onto a google doc.         Although I successfully implemented the idea, there was a greater problem that I wish I did         notice much sooner, and that was that the idea to begin with was garbage! My idea was to have         on my cover letter a section that says 'Hey, I know you are looking for these requirements and         I want to show you that I carefully read it and do in fact satisfy these requirements.' But what         happens is that I just copy-paste those detail from the posting onto my cover letter.

Well after a week of sending out job         applications using my lovely chrome extension I had to unfortunately conclude that this idea I had         has no value. Either way I managed to scrap this idea and recycle some of the code to make an extension         for spreeding through webpages.
